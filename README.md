# F# Data Visualisation test using Fable and Behaviors with Pixi.js

![Wip Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitetigle/fable-behaviors/master/out/wip.gif)


## Fable 0.7.x
*This project uses an old version of Fable (<1.2.4) and Pixi (3.0.9) and may not build at all. Just ping me if you want me to update the sample with new Fable (>=1.2.x) and new pixi (4.x)*

# Information
Live version: https://whitetigle.github.io/fable-behaviors/

[Note]: if nothing happens after loading: 
Open the debug console and remove the data from Local Storage under *https://whitetigle.github.io/fable-behaviors/* then refresh the page  
That's because Github needs to cache your results first after the first request. So the second request always works.
