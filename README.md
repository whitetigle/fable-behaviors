# F# Data Visualisation test using Fable and Behaviors with Pixi.js

![Wip Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whitetigle/fable-behaviors/master/out/wip.gif)

- `npm install` to install dependencies.
- `npm run build` to compile the F# code to JS.
- `npm run build -- --watch` to compile the F# code to JS. + watch
- `npm start` to fire up a local server and open the sample web page.
- `npm run sync` to launch browser sync.

Live version: https://whitetigle.github.io/fable-behaviors/

[Note]: if nothing happens after loading: 
Open the debug console and remove the data from Local Storage under *https://whitetigle.github.io/fable-behaviors/* then refresh the page  
That's because Github needs to cache your results first after the first request. So the second request always works.
